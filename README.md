## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Vasily Freyberg, and I am a QA Engineer.
I havenâ€™t always been in the IT industry, but in every position I've held, Iâ€™ve consistently strived to ensure the highest quality in both my work and the products I worked with.

For over 10 years, I was involved in supporting innovative technology projectsâ€”from the initial idea formulation stage to business launch. My responsibilities included helping startup teams develop product concepts, create business models, and secure funding to bring their ideas to life.

This work required continuous collaboration through meetings and discussions to clarify product parameters and features. I also took an active part in preparing various presentation materials, including pitch decks, funding applications, and scientific and technical reports, all while adhering to the strict requirements and rules of funding programs.

When I started considering a career transition and exploring a new career path, I realized that my previous experience had helped me develop transferable soft skills that are highly applicable to the QA Engineer profession.

Recently, I completed a 5-month online bootcamp at TripleTen in the QA Tester program, during which I worked on 9 practical projects. This experience allowed me to gain foundational professional skills and solidify my understanding of the field. I am now eager to grow and develop further in the QA field.
